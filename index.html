    <p7>We all share a common home - Earth, an extremely diverse one.</p7><p5></p5><p5>Thousands or even millions of different cultures exist in the world, though we might not realize it. There are 3,000 ethnicities in Africa, whose people speak over 2,000 languages. China has 56 ethnic groups, with Han being the largest ethnicity in the world, whose population makes up 92% of the total population of the world.</p5><p5></p5><p5>Each ethnic group has their own unique culture, this forms our diverse society. However, the diversity is a double-edged sword. Conflicts often occur when one’s value clashes with other people from a different culture. Globally, the conflicts arose from the cultural difference are getting more and more serious, and they even impact the relationship between countries.</p5><p5></p5><p6>As a citizen, we are unlikely to influence the political decision of our government, but what we can do is to appreciate different cultures, and music aids this process. The music we like or create are often influenced by our culture, and the exchange of musical ideas between musicians from different cultures is a way to share different cultures, and learning to understanding them.</p6>

      <p>Motif Cultural Project (Motif) is a 501(c)(3) certified non-profit corporation based in Philadelphia. Motif is founded by a group of passionate musicians, who are also avid cultural advocates. We firmly believe that, as a universal language, music would bring us closer together. The music we create or listen to is often times heavily influenced by our cultural background, and by working with musicians from another culture, the exchange of musical ideas would facilitate a deeper understanding of another culture.</p><p5></p5><p5>In the music scene, some ethnic groups and genders are often timers underrepresented. Motif aim to provide an opportunity for every musicians to express themselves, and exchange their ideas with other musicians. Because music is often times heavily influenced by the culture, connecting musicians of diverse backgrounds provides an alternative mean of culture diffusion and connection within the community.</p5><p5></p5><p5>We also hold the belief that every passionate musician should be able to pursue their dream, as music is the most powerful and influential in one’s life. In response to this, Motif would provide educational and / or monetary support to musicians in need.</p5><p5></p5><p5>Although we are just established, we already have many exciting initiatives planned. For the first few years, we plan to work with the musicians in the Philadelphia area, which would set up a solid foundation for our further scaling in the future.</p5><p5></p5><p6>Meet our founder and director Teri Ke.</p6>
